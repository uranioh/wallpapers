# Desktop and Mobile Wallpapers
This is a collection of wallpapers for both desktop and mobile.

## How to contribute
Anyone is free to create any commit regardless of wallpaper type or resolution **with the following exceptions**: 
- I will **only** accept images with the shortest edge equal to / greater than **1080 pixels**. _Heck it's 2022_.
- I will not accept any kind of wallpaper showing nudity and stuff like that. _Self explainatory_.
- I will not accept any wallpaper that fits only a certain device or group of devices. For example, no wallpapers with dedicated sections or borders for iPhone ([Example Here](https://www.pinterest.it/pin/789959590864839408/)).

## How to use the repository
GitHub image viewer works like ass. If you can't figure out how to navigate through the selection of wallpapers, **Git Clone** this repository into your pc and use your preferred image viewer locally. ~~Windows Photos is garbage so don't use that, thanks~~.
